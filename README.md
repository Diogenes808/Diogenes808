👋 Hi, I’m @Diogenes808

🌞 I'm passionate about Solarpunk—a movement envisioning a brighter, sustainable future where renewable energy, community empowerment, and ecological harmony thrive. I seek to harness the power of data science and statistical modeling to represent 
environmental challenges tangibly and create viable solutions that align with the Solarpunk ethos.

👀 I’m interested in:
- Exploring how data science intersects with environmental issues, particularly in the realm of renewable energy adoption, sustainable urban planning, and climate change mitigation.
- Leveraging financial modeling techniques to analyze and advocate for investment in eco-friendly technologies, community-driven projects, and initiatives fostering a regenerative relationship with our planet.

🌱 I’m currently learning:
- My near term focus is learning to create algorythmic trading bots.
- My longer term focus is on Data science methodologies and tools, especially focusing on their application in environmental analysis and sustainability metrics and applying this to community development.
- Financial modeling techniques to assess the economic viability and impact of green technologies and initiatives for sustainable communities.


💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Projects that use data-driven approaches to address environmental challenges and promote Solarpunk principles.
- Initiatives combining financial expertise and environmental advocacy to create tangible, actionable solutions for a more sustainable future.
- Collaborative efforts integrating technology, community engagement, and ecological innovation to build resilient, eco-friendly systems.

Let's connect and work together towards a Solarpunk-inspired future where data science and financial modeling play pivotal roles in crafting meaningful solutions for our planet's well-being.
